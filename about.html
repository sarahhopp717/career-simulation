        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>When I'm not working my booty off, I enjoy the following things</p>
        <section>
          <h3>YOGA</h3>

          <p>
            Yoga has literally changed my life. I got into a pretty bad accident
            in college. I got hit by a bus, yikes! I wasnt able to even bend
            down and touch my knees. Now, after over 10 years of consistently
            going since that accident, I can comfortably say that I am a real
            Yogi, and I wouldn't change it for anything.

          <h3>DRUMMER</h3>

          />
          <p>
            I started playing the drums when I was 20. I got an acoustic kit
            from a buddy in high school that was getting deployed and had no use
            for his kit anymore. What an aventure it has been to go from never
            thinking I was "cool" enough to be a drummer, to then having
            multiple YouTube channels where I have solely created my own tracks
            for people to view and listen. Finding an instrument that can match
            my ADHD brain has been so beneficial for me. Having six different
            things to do at once was easier for me than just playing the piano!

          <p>
            After getting married in 2022, my wife and I sold all of our
            belongings, besides the essentials, and bought a trailer to travel
            the country for a whole year. It was the best experience, I would
            recommend to anyone that wants to really connect with nature, and
            test their limits with budgeting, planning, and everything that
            comes with traveling.
